What this does:<br>
• The plugin improves your life by adding a toggle switch switch to easily turn on and off any plugin without refreshing the page.
• It removes the deactivate and activate link that typically exists on the plugin

Current issues:<br>
• The toggle does not properly work. I can't yet figure out what is preventing it from actually toggling. It does correctly display the which plugins are active and which are not.
• Does not push the toggle to the far left on every plugin
• The toggle does not appear on any other plugin admin page other than "ALL"

Future Improvements:<br>
• Add a "Delete Icon" to replace the link, have it always present even if the plugin is active, include a confirmation modal.
